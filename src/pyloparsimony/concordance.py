Concordance factor computation.

This module provides basic code for the computation of the rooted site
concordance factor, an extension to the site concordance factor proposed by
Minh et al (2020). 

Rooted Site Concordance Factor
------------------------------

We introduce two major improvements over the site concordance factor discussed
by Minh et al. (2020). First, we provide a way to compute the site concordance
factor for rooted trees, introducing the notion of weakly and strongly
concordant quartets. Second, we apply significance testing in order to make
sure that the concordances obtained for a given tree and a given number of
characters are large enough to make it unlikely that they could have arisen by
chance. 

The distinction between weakly and strongly concordant quartets is derived from
the need that in order to be concordant with a rooted tree, not all quartets
need to be strict bipartitions that split the quartets into two. Alternatively,
they could also be what we call weakly concordant, and only separate the main
node being investigated during each step.
